# WP Price Manager

WP Price Manager is a WordPress plugin for managing service prices and displaying them with an Elementor widget. It lets you create categories of services, associate them with price groups, and edit everything in a user friendly interface.

## Installation

1. Copy the `WP Price Manager` folder to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate **WP Price Manager** in the WordPress admin panel.
3. Make sure Elementor 3.5+ is installed and active to use the widget.

## Usage

After activation new menu items appear under **Price Manager**:

- **Категории** – create and sort service categories with drag-and-drop and quickly add services within a category.
- **Все услуги** – add and search services. The form provides autocomplete for categories and price groups.
- **Группа цен** – manage price groups. Editing a group prompts for confirmation before bulk price updates.

### Elementor Widget

In the Elementor editor search for **Price List**. Drop the widget onto the page and select a service category in the **Content** tab. Style the table in the **Style** tab (colors, borders, alignment, etc.). Each row displays an info icon; hover or tap it to view the service description.
